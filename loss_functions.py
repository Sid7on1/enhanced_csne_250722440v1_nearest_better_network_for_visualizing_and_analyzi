# Custom loss functions
class NearestBetterNetworkLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    Nearest Better Network Loss for training a unified tool for visualizing and analyzing combinatorial optimization problems.

    This loss function is based on the research paper: 'Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool'
    by Yiya Diao et al.

    This loss function calculates the NBN loss, which is useful for understanding the behavior of optimization algorithms.
    It handles velocity-threshold and flow theory as mentioned in the paper.

    ----------
    margin : float
        Margin value for the hinge loss.
    velocity_threshold : float
        Threshold for velocity beyond which an improvement is considered significant.
    use_flow_theory : bool
        Whether to apply flow theory correction.
    gamma : float
        Gamma value for flow theory correction.

    Methods
    -------
    forward(inputs, labels)
        Computes the NBN loss for a batch of inputs and corresponding labels.
